# AI-Generated-Blogger-Theme-Base-On-Image
Collection of Blogger theme templates based on uploaded media file.

## About

A curious experiment of no real productive nature- Just for "fun". To explore what AI comes back with giving it the limitted content that it will be given. With focus on an image and as little guidance through links and supplimentary data as possibe.


## Example
### The Cheap Yellow Display

AI generated theme template base off of uploaded image- the image is of a ESP32 'Cheap Yellow Display"(CYD). 

>[Notes]
> There had been some "guidance" provided, by including some links. These links contained official specifications, descriptions along with providing the most popular uses for the CYD. Any suplimental data; be it extra images, relative links, brand / company/ bios, links to content that speak directly about subject matter- maybe a link to the most popular project or a forum post/ forum posts which have extensive discussiom regarding subject within image, most starred/ official github, etc... will be documented. These will have great thought put into them in desciding to be included. They should strongly resonate with subject- first things that come to mind when thinking about it. However possible these extras will be limited. The focus is on the theme generation from image- a "bias" of of what AI "sees", not reads about or discovers.

The image that had been provided was that of the PCB in its final form. Just the PCB. It had been chosen for its unique characteristics, physical attributes... being that bright yellow with the gold
/ silver traces ... it is unique and isn't your typical PCB/ development boasrd austhetic. It is easilly identified and even has a moniker given to it as the "CYD" or Cheap Yellow Device.

Details provided on the main page of each "experiment".

Here's the result I got back from Gemini using "thinking" through the Gemeni Pro model.   [(https://thatyellowdisplayyousawonamazon.blogspot.com/](https://thatyellowdisplayyousawonamazon.blogspot.com/)

## Future Experiments

I am just doing this for S ^% Gs... ever so often when my mind descides too be bored at whattever it is I am working on and requires a distraction. There are some ideas for the next subjets... here are some: Levis Jeans, Tear Away athletic pants, tug boat, a cellebrity series with  a number of celebrities will be used and results compaired to one another, a sports car/ beater, a drone/ tiny whoop... just some ideas for future experiments.
